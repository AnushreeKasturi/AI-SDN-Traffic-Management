# AI-Driven Adaptive Network Traffic Management using SDN and Machine Learning

A computer-networks mini project that simulates a **Software-Defined Network (SDN)
controller** which uses **machine learning** to classify traffic and predict
congestion, then reroutes flows adaptively — and compares it against a
traditional **static, non-adaptive** routing scheme on the same topology and
the same traffic.

Open **`index.html`** in any browser — it's a self-contained dashboard (no
server needed) that presents the whole project to your teacher: architecture,
topology, ML model performance, and the static-vs-adaptive results, all
generated from the actual simulation run in `src/`.

---

## 1. Problem statement

Traditional networks (OSPF/static routing) pick a path based on fixed link
costs (like hop count or delay) and **never change it based on current
traffic**. If a "shortest" path gets congested, every new flow still piles
onto it — causing high latency and packet loss — while a different, slightly
longer path sits idle.

**Idea:** give the network's controller a global view (this is exactly what
SDN provides) plus a machine-learning brain that can (a) tell what *kind* of
traffic a flow is, and (b) forecast which links are *about to* get congested.
Use both to pick better paths in real time.

## 2. Architecture

```
 Flow stats  ─▶ [1] Traffic Classifier (Random Forest)
 (from switches)      classifies: voice / video / web / bulk
                              │
                              ▼
 Link history ─▶ [2] Congestion Predictor (RF Regressor)
                      forecasts next-interval utilization per link
                              │
                              ▼
                 [3] SDN Controller (Dijkstra, re-weighted)
                      path cost = base delay
                               + (current load)^3  x priority factor
                               + (forecast load)^3 x priority factor
                              │
                              ▼
                 [4] Flow rules pushed to switches (simulated)
```

This mirrors a real deployment: a **Ryu** or **ONOS** controller app would
poll OpenFlow switch statistics, run the same two ML models, and call
`nx.shortest_path` (or an equivalent path computation) with adaptive weights
before pushing flow-mod messages to switches. The topology in `topology.py`
is written the same way you'd declare it in **Mininet** (`addLink(s1, s2,
bw=100, delay='2ms')`), so this simulation can be ported to a real Mininet +
Ryu setup with minimal changes if you want to extend the project.

## 3. What's simulated

- **Topology** (`src/topology.py`): 8 OpenFlow switches in a partial mesh (so
  redundant paths genuinely exist between most switch pairs) + 6 hosts, each
  link with its own capacity (Mbps) and propagation delay.
- **Traffic generator** (`src/traffic_gen.py`): synthetic flows from 4
  application classes (voice, video, web, bulk), each with realistic packet
  size / inter-arrival-time / duration / demand distributions — similar in
  spirit to real traffic-classification datasets.
- **ML models** (`src/ml_models.py`):
  - `TrafficClassifier` — Random Forest, trained on 1500 synthetic flows,
    ~99–100% held-out accuracy (the classes are statistically well
    separated, similar to real QoS classification papers).
  - `CongestionPredictor` — Random Forest Regressor on lag features,
    forecasts a link's utilization one interval ahead.
- **Controller simulation** (`src/controller_sim.py`): runs 24 controller
  intervals. In every interval it generates flows, classifies them, and
  routes them **twice** — once with static shortest-path routing, once with
  the AI-adaptive controller — so both strategies see *identical* traffic and
  only the routing decision differs.
- **Experiment driver** (`src/run_experiment.py`): runs everything, saves
  `results/results.json` (all the numbers behind the dashboard) and
  `results/topology.png` (the topology diagram).

## 4. How to run it yourself

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
python3 run_experiment.py
```

This regenerates `results/results.json` and `results/topology.png`. To
rebuild `index.html` from those results (optional — a copy is already
included), see the inline comments in `run_experiment.py`; the dashboard
simply embeds that JSON and image.

## 5. Key results (from the included run)

| Metric | Static routing | AI-Adaptive routing |
|---|---|---|
| Traffic classification accuracy | — | ~99.7% |
| Average flow latency | baseline | ~15% lower |
| Peak link utilization | baseline | ~39% lower |
| Congested / dropped flows | 23 | 0 |

The adaptive controller trades a small amount of routing simplicity for a
large reduction in congestion and drops — because it can see current load
*and* forecast future load, while static routing is blind to both.

## 6. Viva / demo talking points

- **Why SDN, specifically?** Static/distributed protocols like OSPF can't
  react to real-time traffic because no single node has a global view. SDN's
  centralized controller is what makes ML-driven, whole-network optimization
  possible in the first place.
- **Why two ML models and not one?** Classification (what *kind* of traffic)
  and forecasting (what will the *network* look like next) are different
  problems — one is about the flow, the other is about the link. Keeping
  them separate also means either could be swapped for a different model
  (e.g. an LSTM for the time-series part) without touching the other.
- **Why Random Forest?** Good accuracy on tabular, low-dimensional flow
  features, fast to train/infer (matters for a controller making real-time
  decisions), and gives interpretable feature importances — shown in the
  dashboard.
- **What would change for a real deployment?** Replace `topology.py`'s graph
  with a live OpenFlow topology discovery module, replace `traffic_gen.py`
  with real sFlow/NetFlow/OpenFlow stats polling, and replace the simulated
  "push flow rules" step with actual `OFPFlowMod` messages via Ryu/ONOS.

## 8. Two ways to explore this project

This project ships in two layers, and it's worth being clear about which is
which when you present it:

- **`src/` — a fast, large-scale simulation.** Pure Python (networkx +
  scikit-learn), no real network stack. Lets you sweep 24 controller
  intervals and dozens of flows in seconds, which is what the dashboard's
  quantitative comparison (`index.html`) is built from.
- **`mininet_sdn/` — a real SDN deployment.** Actual Mininet switches, real
  Open vSwitch, a real OpenFlow controller (`os-ken`) making live routing
  decisions from real port/flow statistics. Slower to run and smaller in
  scope (a handful of flows, not 24 intervals), but it's the real thing —
  see `mininet_sdn/README_MININET.md` for a captured example where the
  AI-driven controller detects real congestion on a live link and reroutes
  a new flow around it while the baseline controller doesn't.

Presenting both makes the strongest case: the simulation shows the idea
holds up quantitatively at scale, and the Mininet deployment proves the
same logic runs as a real, working SDN controller.
